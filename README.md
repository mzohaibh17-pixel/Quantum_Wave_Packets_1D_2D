# Quantum Wave Packets in 1D and 2D

## Overview
This project demonstrates **quantum wave packet simulations** in both **1D and 2D infinite potential wells** using Python.  
It includes **stationary wavefunctions**, **probability densities**, and **time-dependent animations** of 1D wave packets, as well as **2D probability density plots**.  

This project is designed to showcase **computational physics skills** for CVs and GitHub portfolios.

## Features

### 1D Simulations
- **Stationary Wavefunctions:** First three eigenstates ψ₁(x), ψ₂(x), ψ₃(x)  
- **Probability Density:** Ground state probability |ψ₁(x)|²  
- **Time-Dependent Wave Packet:** Superposition of first two states with animation showing |Ψ(x,t)|² over time
